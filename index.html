        <h2>Example: New York's Ban on Social Media for Kids</h2>
        
        <p>
            New York recently created a law to keep kids under 13 from using social media without their parents' permission. The goal is to protect kids from 
            online dangers like bullying or seeing things that aren’t right for their age.
            <br><br>
            Some people think this law helps keep kids safe, while others believe it limits freedom. Either way, it's a big change, and other states may decide 
            to follow New York's lead.

            <h3>What Does the Law Say?</h3>
            <p>
                This law requires social media companies to verify the age of users. Kids under 13 need their parents' permission to join, and companies 
                that don’t follow the rules could get fined. The law is part of a bigger plan to keep kids safe online.

        <div class="question">
            <h2>1. What kind of government does this country have?</h2>
            <p>
                The U.S. is a **democracy**, which means people vote to choose leaders who make decisions. Each state can also make its own laws. 
                In this case, New York’s government decided to create this law to protect children online. Citizens vote for the people who make these laws, 
                so they have a say in decisions like this one.
            </p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>2. How is this law affecting people's lives?</h2>
            <p>
                The law is making parents feel safer about what their kids do online. But some people don’t like that the government is making such strict rules. 
                Tech companies are now changing their rules to follow the new law, and this could affect how kids use social media all over the U.S.

                <p>
                    Schools are also affected by this law. Teachers have to make sure kids aren’t using social media in class without permission, and they need 
                    to think carefully about how they use technology in their lessons.

        <div class="question">
            <h2>3. Do people respond differently because of the type of government?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, because in a democracy, people can share their opinions about the law. Some think it’s great because it keeps kids safe. Others worry 
                that it’s too controlling. People can talk to their leaders and even try to change the law if they don’t agree with it.
